[[what-is]]
== What is Anypoint Platform?

The Anypoint Platform is an end-to-end resource for digital connectivity. *Anypoint Platform* comprises a complete application and API development suite that you can use to create, integrate, model, build, and deploy services, applications and APIs.

With the platform tools you can accelerate development and deployment of applications and APIs. You can deploy your Mule integration applications and APIs to servers managed by your organization or those hosted by MuleSoft.

[NOTE]
Consider API-led connectivity when connecting assets. APIs allow the developer to modify assets and redeploy them without having to compromise the APIs that consume the assets.


== How to Get Started


The best way to learn is to access the cloud version of Anypoint Platform.

link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup?apintent=exchange[Create an Anypoint Platform account] online or use link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/[Anypoint Platform On-Prem] to deploy the platform to your infrastructure on-premises.

If you are going to develop APIs or Mule applications to connect your digital assets, set up your workstation according to the link:/#dev-checklist[Getting Started Developer Checklist].

If you are going to manage deployments and administration, go through the link:/#getting-started-deploy[Getting Started Deployment Checklist]

[[getting-started-dev]]
=== Getting Started Checklist for Development

After obtaining access to the Anypoint Platform, set up your workstation for Mule application development using Studio to develop Mule apps or APIs. Once you create an integration application on Studio, test and run it on an embedded Mule runtime server.

. Install Anypoint Studio, which comes with Mule runtime.
+
[NOTE]
link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/configuring-maven-to-work-with-mule-esb[Configure Maven] to properly manage dependencies used in your Mule apps.
+
. If you are an API developer, ensure you use link:/api-manager/[API Manager], accessible from your platform instance, to design, publish and manage APIs
. Check out available resources to use in your organization from link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange], where you can find templates, resources and publish private repositories.

[NOTE]
With the platform, you can sync Mule projects, APIs and assets between teams.


[[getting-started-deploy]]
=== Getting Started Checklist for Deployment

After you perform tests on Mule applications and APIs, deploy them locally or to a cloud server.

. Choose a deployment model:
- Mule runtime on-prem (installed in the company's datacenter)
- Mule runtime in MuleSoft's cloud: CloudHub.
- Mule runtime in other cloud products, e.g. AWS, Digital Ocean, etc
- Mixed ("hybrid" scenario)
. Choose a management tool for your apps and APIs
- Mule runtime managed through the Runtime Manager, which is part of the Anypoint Platform
- Mule runtime managed with Mule Management Console, a legacy deployment product
- Mule runtime managed and/or monitored by third party applications (for example: Nagios, Zabbix)

[NOTE]
Use Runtime Manager to deploy a Mule app to CloudHub.

[[app-network]]
== Building an Application Network

Developing an application network is a process that involves redefining interactions with existing digital resources by creating APIs at different levels of the enterprise, from the backend systems to the user experience, as explained in link:#design-develop-apis[Desiging and Developing APIs], allowing you to abstract away complexity at different organizational tiers. These APIs can be recomposed or changed out as business demands change.

MuleSoft provides the tools needed to create the APIs and applications, which are the nodes in this network that mediate between your systems and SaaS applications. Read the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/api/application-network[Application Network whitepaper].

The Anypoint Platform offers you a rich set of tools to deploy, manage, and operate your integration applications you have developed to run on Mule runtime. The platform enables you to cover many use cases for businesses. You can run your apps on servers in the *cloud*, *on-premises*, or some *hybridized* version. You can manage and monitor legacy or platform APIs and manage API consumption via auto-generated proxy.

[[design-develop-apis]]
=== Designing and Developing APIs

To elaborate on what design and development means for business transformation, consider the data you want to provide, govern, transform, and expose at various levels of your organization, both internally and for customers.

After planning your development strategy, you are ready to begin designing APIs to support each piece of the connectivity puzzle for your organization. We recommend using link:http://raml.org/[RAML], the API-modeling language, to describe your APIs. RAML allows you to define the methods and resources of a REST-ful API in a syntax similar to that of *YAML*. The Anypoint Platform even uses RAML to auto-generate interactive API documentation for each API via its own API Portal, and Anypoint Studio uses RAML scaffolded Mule flows to implement APIs.

Use link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer] from within your browser for design tasks, or link:/apikit/[APIkit] from Studio, which is commonly leveraged to implement an API in a Mule application. You can manage APIs defined in any format, by proxy for example. We promote API development following an API model where APIs are segmented into three logical layers of your organization:

* *System APIs* - provide access to backend systems given appropriate permissions
* *Process APIs* - decouple data transformation from backend systems and other processes
* *Experience APIs* - collates data to provide the presentation layer for end user, internal or external to your organization

[TIP]
See how API architecture goes hand in hand with link:#app-network[Building an Application Network]

=== Developing Mule Applications

To ramp up quickly with link:https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/what-mule-esb[Mule runtime], a flexible ESB to connect services or applications together quickly, read the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8[Mule runtime documentation]. Familiarize yourself with link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio], an IDE. Studio is mainly a visual design tool, and does not require in-depth knowledge of Mule runtime. However, you can configure many Mule app and runtime attributes from within the IDE.

[NOTE]
Start setting up your link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment[Anypoint Studio Development Environment].
You can design and develop your Mule applications using either the:

* *Graphical user interface* for drag-and-drop of flow elements and easy configuration in properties windows, or
* An *XML editor* where these same elements can be configured

Each building block in a Mule application flow represents a modular part of a process along which Mule messages are transmitted. Thanks to link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/datasense[DataSense], you can visualize the metadata structure of a Mule message at any given point in a flow. This data may be accessed and referenced within your app, using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language (MEL)], which is a Mule application-specific syntax. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] is a powerful tool for data transformation accessible from the *Transform Message* component. Use Dataweave to transform data from one type to another through its intuitive UI. You can also code the desired transformation by hand in the editor.

[TIP]
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-message-structure[See] what is inside a Mule message.


Mule supports very many internet communications protocols out of the box, such as FTP and SMTP. Mule applications support use and re-use of elements called link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] that facilitate connections, normally to web services which handle essential business services: databases, SaaS providers, payment systems, etc. See the whole connector offering here on link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange].

[TIP]
If you do not see the Anypoint Connector you need in Anypoint Exchange, consider creating your own connector using the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[Set up your development environment] and follow the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/devkit-tutorial[DevKit Tutorial].

You can also use link:/anypoint-mq/[Anypoint MQ] to coordinate messaging between applications, Object Store to share content between applications, and more.

After your Mule application has been designed, you can seamlessly add _unit testing_ to your continuous development environment using link:/munit/v/1.2.0/[MUnit], a Mule application testing framework embedded within Studio.

Make sure that your integrations and APIs behave the way you intend by designing and running _test suites_, a collection of tests using resources such as _assertions_, _verifications_, _mocks_, and _spies_. +
MUnit also allows you to run integration tests in a local environment allowing you to start a local FTP/SFTP, DB, or mail server.

Get quality metrics for your development by running link:/munit/v/1.2.0/munit-maven-support#coverage[coverage reports].

You can run your application and test suite from within the IDE using the embedded *Mule runtime*, or deploy your application to production (or a development environment) in the cloud on *CloudHub*, also without having to leave the IDE.



== Management and Monitoring Tools

After deploying your integration application, you can manage it, depending on how your application is deployed.

Several tools are available for you to monitor your application's performance, and subsequently debug any issues that arise. These include link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[automated alerts], interactive dashboards with data at the server and application level, and link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[event logs].


=== Runtime Manager

//image:runtime-manager-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high,width=26]

link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] provides multiple tools to link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Manage] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitor] your applications and, for those running on-prem, the servers they run on. Runtime Manager provides a single "glass pane" through which you can view all activity relevant to your running Mule applications, regardless of deployment scenario (cloud/on-prem).

Built on top of Mule, Runtime Manager allows you to integrate and orchestrate application activity, data sources, and services across on-prem systems and the cloud.

Runtime Manager exposes important information about your live applications and the servers they are deployed to in real time using:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[E-mail alerts] triggered by customizable events
* link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[In-platform event notifications]
* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards[Monitoring dashboards] that display performance metrics of both applications and servers
* Transaction-level detail through the link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insights page]
* link:/runtime-manager/logs[Event logs] for applications deployed to the cloud.
* Applications deployed on-premises can link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[send log information to third party software]

Additionally, if your application is deployed to the cloud, you can link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[manage many features of CloudHub deployment] using Runtime Manager:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Stores]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-queues[Queues]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties]
* link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[Virtual Private Cloud]




[TIP]
To better understand how options differ between applications deployed to CloudHub and those deployed on-premises, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule].


=== API Manager

//image:api-logo.png[AnypointAPI_manager,width=26]

link:/api-manager[API Manager], formerly known as *Anypoint Platform for APIs*, is an API and service registry and governance platform. Built from the ground up to support cloud and hybrid use cases, the platform governs all of your service and API assets, whether internal or external, behind a firewall or in the cloud, all via one platform. Place a proxy in front of your application to apply traffic policies, view usage metrics and more.

You can either register a Mule application by imbuing it with link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery parameters], or taking an existing legacy API and triggering creation of a Mule proxy to govern and monitor the API. Either case results in registration of your API with your API Manager.

Once an API is registered, you can easily link:/api-manager/applying-custom-policies[apply governance policies] to it via the web UI, such as *throttling* or *API whitelisting*. Apply such policies after providing parameter values, and then simply by clicking the *Activate* button. You can also generate your own custom policies if you require something that isn't covered by the lengthy list of pre-built policies.

With your API registered, Anypoint Platform will start link:/analytics/analytics-chart[tracking analytics] about API usage and performance.

At that point you could create an link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api[API Portal], where users of your API can browse interactive API documentation that is automatically generated from your API's RAML definition file. You can expose other content from this API Portal as well.

[TIP]
The platform supports maintenance of multiple versions of an API, each with its independent set of policies, analytics and portal.

==== Managing a Legacy API

Alternatively, you may want to use Anypoint Platform to manage an API that was not developed using MuleSoft software. In that case, you can use the <<API Manager>> to deploy an auto-generated proxy. Through this proxy, Anypoint Platform can apply policies and obtain analytics information.

// this sub section might be redundant, as it's sort of explained already

=== Anypoint Platform Access Management

//image:settings-logo.png[access management,width=26]

As an administrator of your organization using the *Access Management* tool, you can manage user access and clearance level for your organization, its business groups, as well as access to the rest of its Anypoint Platform tools.
//wasn't totally clear on the above, esp access to AP Platform

Create custom roles for users of Runtime Manager and grant custom permissions to control activities among teams that otherwise share the same access privileges. link:/access-management/external-identity[Set up external identities] to manage users and clients using your organization's external federated identity system.


=== Mule Management Console (MMC)

//image:mmc.png[mmc,width=26]

link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/[MMC] provides robust runtime management capabilities for on-premises deployments, including high-availability clustering, monitoring features, email alerts, logs, etc.


[NOTE]
MMC is pending full replacement by Runtime Manager, and hence will eventually be deprecated. There is a migration tool for migrating your MMC deployments to Runtime Manager.

== Tools for User and Developer Communities

After your application or API has been designed, deployed, and managed to guarantee best performance, it is time for you to _engage_ your developers and users by making this content available to them, to amplify the utility of your application or API in your organization.

=== Anypoint Exchange

link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange] lets you create organization-specific repositories called _private exchanges_ where you can share templates, connectors, examples, RAMLs, and WSDLs throughout your organization. You can also find  artifacts published by MuleSoft on the public link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/[Exchange] site. Whether private or public, Exchange lets you create pages for each item with explanation text, videos of how to use the artifact, and links to documentation.

=== API Portals

After deploying an API, use API Portals to publicize the API and attract a user community. Create a multi-page portal for users to consume your public APIs and find assets, such as examples and policies, and set up users to access your private APIs. From the portal editing environment, include an API Notebook to convey technical workflows, for example, how to make an authenticated call to your RAML-based API. Include images, attachments, and an API Console for simulating calls to your RAML-based API. Engage the community through interaction with the API to solicit feedback and contributions. 

=== API Notebook

The best way to present your API to users is through the link:/api-manager/creating-an-api-notebook[API Notebook], a web-based, persistent, JavaScript-supported workspace that can generate an API client from a RAML API definition.

This allows users to explore and test examples for the resources in your API, executing authenticated live calls to an API on a real server or on an empty API interface.

You can make the API Notebook available to everyone and even save it as a "gist" in your GitHub account, making it versionable, forkable, shareable, and embeddable anywhere as markdown text.
