== Introduction

The *Anypoint Connector DevKit*, or simply *DevKit*, enables the development of link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors]. An *Anypoint Connector* is an extension module to the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform that facilitates communication between third-party systems/APIs and Mule applications.

[NOTE]
====
*Anypoint Connector DevKit 3.9 is the latest version of DevKit*, offering connector end user support in a few aspects of Mule app design in Studio. Requirements and suggestions for writing connector code using DevKit have not changed since version 3.8.

[IMPORTANT]
*DevKit version number* does not follow Mule versioning. *DevKit 3.8*-built connectors work with *Mule 3.5.3 onward*.

== Developing Connectors with DevKit

This is what you need to develop *DevKit-based Anypoint Connectors* on your system with your instance of Anypoint Studio.

. See detailed instructions link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[here] on how to install:  link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java JDK version 8], link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven], link:https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[Anypoint Studio], and link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[Anypoint DevKit Plugin] to build and test your connector. You can develop a connector using Windows, Mac, or Linux.
. _New Connector:_

. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-api-access[Determine resource access] - Each resource has a different access method, such as REST, SOAP, FTP, or the Java SDK features.
. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/authentication[Choose an authentication mechanism] - Mule supports OAuth V1 or V2, and username and password authentication (known as link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/connection-management[connection management]), which can be used for protocols such as API Key, SAML, NTLM, Kerberos, or LDAP.
. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/connector-attributes-and-operations[Choose the connector's data model] - Models can be static Java objects or dynamic objects. You can use link:/anypoint-studio/v/5/datasense[DataSense] - Determine what information the target resource expects.
. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/defining-connector-attributes[Add connector @ attribute annotations] - Create code for your connector containing the @ attributes that Mule uses to designate the important parts of your connector.
. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/developing-devkit-connector-tests[Code tests] - Tests can be unit tests, functional tests, and Studio interoperability tests.
. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/connector-reference-documentation[Document your connector] - MuleSoft provides a template that helps you fill in the blanks to create documentation to help your staff and others understand the features and use of your connector.

== DevKit Features

Features DevKit provides:

* Visual design and implementation using Anypoint Studio with an Eclipse-based interface that simplifies and speeds up development.
* Maven support.
* Connector packaging tools.
* Authentication support for multiple types of authentication, including OAuth and username and password authentication.
* DataSense support to acquire remote metadata.
* Extensive testing capability.
* Examples, training, and support to simplify development startup.
* Batch, Query Pagination, and DataSense Query Language support.

DevKit is a annotations-based tool, with a wide set of available annotations to support its features. For a complete list of DevKit annotations, see the link:http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-devkit/[Annotation Reference].

== Coding a Connector

DevKit lets you build connectors from scratch. Before creating your own connector, check the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&sortBy=name[Anypoint Exchange] for available connectors. The connectors page also lists Community open source connectors that let you contribute to the growing community of public connector development.

== REST Versus SOAP Connectors

REST simplifies access to HTTP using POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE calls to provide access to creating, getting, putting, and deleting information on a resource.

DevKit currently provides a strategy for link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/creating-a-connector-for-a-restful-api-using-jersey[Creating a Connector for a RESTful API Using Jersey] to build a REST API-supported connector.

SOAP is a traditional means of communicating with a resource and requires a WSDL file, which is an XML file that specifies all aspects of a Java class’s structure, methods, properties, and documentation. SOAP is an industry standard with tools for governance, building, and schema information. DevKit provides a tools that helps building a connector using a WSDL file.
