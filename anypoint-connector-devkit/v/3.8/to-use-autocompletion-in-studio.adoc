= To Use Auto-Completion in Studio
:reference:

[NOTE]
This is a Java autocompletion example geared toward connector developers.

When editing your connector's main Java file, the auto-complete function provides a scaffold structure for several common methods that you may want to add. These structures come with rudimentary link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc[Javadoc] documentation, which you should populate so that your project passes build tests successfully and your connector's users can access reference material about your connector.

With your cursor on the @Connector class or any other @ annotation, type *CTRL + spacebar* to view a list of suggested entries:
