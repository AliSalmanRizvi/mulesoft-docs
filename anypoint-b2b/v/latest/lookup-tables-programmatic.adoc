= Lookup Tables

Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) enables you to create, populate and edit a _link:https://docs.staging.modusbox.com/anypoint-b2b/glossary#sectl[lookup table]_.  A lookup table is a table that facilitates transaction processing by associating values. For example, this page shows how to create a lookup table that associates home partner product codes with trading partner product codes.

== Creating a Lookup Table

Lookup tables are created through calls to the link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager-api[Anypoint Partner Manager API].
This section shows the steps necessary to create a three-column, two-key table using link:https://curl.haxx.se/[curl].

=== To Create a Lookup Table

. Create the table:
+
----
curl -X POST -d
'{
  "name": "ProductCodes"
 }' "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/b2b/tpm/api/lookupTables?environmentId=yourEnvironmentId&apiKey=yourAPIKey"

----
+
The API returns a table ID, which you use in subsequent calls.

. Add a field:
+
----

curl -X POST -d
'{
  "name": "InternalProductCode"
}' "http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/b2b/tpm/api/lookupTables/yourTableId/fields?environmentId=yourEnvironmentId&apiKey=yourAPIKey"
----
+
The API returns an ID for the field.

. Use the same syntax to add two more fields:
+
----
curl -X POST -d
'{
  "name": "PartnerName"
}' "http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/b2b/tpm/api/lookupTables/yourTableId/fields?environmentId=yourEnvironmentId&apiKey=yourAPIKey"
----
+
----
curl -X POST -d
'{
  "name": "PartnerProductCode"
}' "http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/b2b/tpm/api/lookupTables/yourTableId/fields?environmentId=yourEnvironmentId&apiKey=yourAPIKey"
----
+
The API returns IDs for each field.

. Add keys (inbound and outbound)
+
*Inbound*
+
The Inbound key is the unique combination of the first and second fields.
+
-----
curl -X POST -H
 '{
  "name": "InboundProductCodes",
  "fieldIds": [
      "fieldId1",
      "fieldId2"
        ]
 }' "http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/b2b/tpm/api/lookupTables/yourTableId/keys?environmentId=yourEnvironmentId&apiKey=yourAPIKey"
-----
+
*Outbound*
+
The Inbound key is the unique combination of the second and third fields.
+
-----
curl -X POST -H
 '{
  "name": "InboundProductCodes",
  "fieldIds": [
      "fieldId2",
      "fieldId3
        ]
 }' "http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/b2b/tpm/api/lookupTables/yourTableId/keys?environmentId=yourEnvironmentId&apiKey=yourAPIKey"
-----
. Use Anypoint Partner Manager to populate the table (see <<Add a Row to a Table>>).

. Query the API to incorporate table data:
+
----
curl -X GET -H  "http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/b2b/tpm/api/lookupTables/lookup?key=OutboundProductCodes&lookupTable=ProductCodes&fields=InternalProductCode:Int1001%26PartnerName:Beta&environmentId=yourEnvironmentId1&apiKey=yourAPIKey"
----
+
NOTE: To query the lookup table from within a Mule flow, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/consuming-a-rest-api[Consuming a REST API].
