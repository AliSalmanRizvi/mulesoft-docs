= Lookup Tables

Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) enables you to create, populate and edit a _link:https://docs.staging.modusbox.com/anypoint-b2b/glossary#sectl[lookup table]_.  A lookup table is a table that facilitates transaction processing by associating values. For example, this page shows how to create a lookup table that associates home partner product codes with trading partner product codes.
