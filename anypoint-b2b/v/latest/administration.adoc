The <<img-administration>> enables you to:

* <<Create a New API Key>>
* <<Get Environment Information>>

WARNING: The API Key is used by any Mule application across your entire Master link:/access-management/organization[Organization] that communicates with Anypoint Partner Manager. Therefore, before you create a new API Key, coordinate with your organization's Mulesoft administrator to ensure that none of your organization's processes are using an existing API Key because, if they are, creating a new API Key will cause them to cease functioning. In that case, instead of creating a new API Key, use the existing API Key.
