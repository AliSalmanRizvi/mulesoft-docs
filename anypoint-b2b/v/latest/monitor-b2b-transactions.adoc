= Monitor B2B Transactions

Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) enables you to monitor B2B _transaction_ data.
A transaction is the full set of end-to-end events (including transmissions, documents, and errors) involved in processing a transmission.

You can:

* Filter to find the specific transaction data for which you are looking
* Review and monitor errors and acknowledgements.
* Search for metadata

This page identifies the APM components you use to monitor transactions; see also link:/anypoint-b2b/tracking-scenarios[Tracking Scenarios].
