:keywords: Anypoint b2b Anypoint Partner Manager concepts


Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) offers a flexible approach to setting up different kinds of configurations
for document definitions, endpoints, and routes. For example, you can configure
a catch-all document definition for a given standard. You can then apply this
definition to your trading partner in case
a document does not match any of the defined document definitions. Going
even further, you can configure a global catch-all for this standard such that it
is applied to all your partners. In order to support this level of flexibility,
configurations are defined at the partner or the home organization level.
APM attempts to resolve a configuration at the home organization level should
it fail to resolve it at the partner level. The next sub-sections  describe in
more detail the resolution process for each type of configuration.

== Document Definition Resolution

As briefly mentioned above, you can configure a document definition to cover
different message types and versions. Leaving a document definitions's message
type and version undefined implicitly means that the document definition can be
applied to any document for the given standard. Alternatively, you can explicitly
set message type and version to the reserved keyword _ANY_ to attain the same
behavior. APM always tries first to match a document to the most specific
document definition before trying to match the document to a more general
document definition. What follows is a flowchart showing the
sequence of decisions APM goes through to arrive at the document
definition to use during route resolution or tracking.

APM comes with pre-configured read-only document definitions for X12 and EDIFACT
that are defined on the home organization. An X12 or EDIFACT document that is not
covered by any user-defined document definition *always* matches to one of
these pre-defined document definitions.

== Endpoint Resolution

Endpoint resolution kicks in when an APM managed connector pulls down its
configuration from APM. The resolution outputs the endpoint that the connector
reads to configure itself. The following factors drive the resolution process:

* Partner
* Endpoint type, that is, send or receive
* Transport type such as AS2
* Document's standard such as X12
* Document's version
* Document's message type

The resolution process for endpoints is shown in the next flowchart:

== Routes Resolution

Calling Partner Manager Connector's _resolve-route_ operation triggers routes
resolution in APM which, similar to endpoint resolution, is driven by the subsequent
factors:

* Partner
* Transport type such as AS2
* Document's standard such as X12
* Document's version
* Document's message type

After taking a closer look, notice that the endpoint type is not included in
the list of factors determining the output of routes. The is because the process
assumes the endpoint to be always of type receive. The following flowchart
describes APM's logic for resolving routes:
