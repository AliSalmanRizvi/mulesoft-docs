== About Global Configurations

By design, Mule applications keep the reusable configurations of connectors separate from the definition of individual instances of them. This is achieved through link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/global-elements[Global Elements], which exist outside any flow, but that can be referenced by elements in them.

In this way, when creating a project that utilizes several instances of a same card, these parameters only need to be provided once and can easily be globally changed.

For example, you could have multiple HTTP connectors in your project, all of them relying on the same host and port and implementing the same SSL certificates, but each triggering a different flow via a different subpath.

== To Create Global Configurations

Many components require that you reference one of these global configurations. If the card requires one, it will notify you with an error message on the top margin, which includes a link that automatically creates a new global message instance.

By clicking on the *Set up* link, you open a new global configuration, which is automatically applied to the currently selected card.

== To Edit Global Configurations

Once you have provided the necessary fields and clicked *Save*, the global configuration is set. If you create any new cards in your flow, these will automatically reference any existing relevant global elements.

Once the component has an assigned global configuration you can click the *Change* link on the component's top bar to then, select a different configuration, or edit the existing one.

All global configurations in your project are listed on the menu on the left, under *Connectors & Modules*. You can edit or delete these directly from this menu.

[TIP]
See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-populate-fields[To Populate Fields] for details on how the Flow Designer UI can make this easier.
