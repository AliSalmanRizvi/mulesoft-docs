= To Debug Flow Designer Projects

Once your project is running on a sandbox server, it's time to try it out. You can verify that it's correctly deployed to the sandbox environment by looking at its status in the nav bar, it should show a green marker and read *Running*.

You can obtain the URL that your project is deployed to by clicking on the dropdown menu next to the status marker and selecting *Copy Link*.

=== Try button

If any of the flows on your project are triggered by a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/poll-reference[Poll] element, then you can trigger that flow manually by clicking on the *Try* button.

== Sending Mock Requests

If any of the flows on your project are triggered by an HTTP listener connector, you can simply open a browser and hit the path where this is exposed. For example if your project is deployed to myapp.cloudhub.io and your flow is triggered by an HTTP connector that is configured to listen on the subpath `/helloworld`, then you should be able to activate that flow by pointing your browser to `myapp.cloudhub.io/helloworld`.

For sending more advanced HTTP requests that include a body or headers, you can use tools like postman or curl.

== Viewing Log Data

As your app is deployed to a sandbox environment, a log displays errors and any data that is sent to console. You can open and view this log by expanding the tab hidden at the bottom of the screen.

If you add a *Logger* card, you can set it up to log any specific part of the Mule Event as it transitions through the flow. The logged information is made visible on this log.

After your flows have been triggered at least once, and actual data has transitioned through them, you can view records of this data as it went through each of the elements in the flow. You can also open an historic view of the messages that came through an element.

[NOTE]
Note that this data is only shown on flow designer when running in development environments. Once you promote your application to a production environment, flow designer can't access data that flows through it.
