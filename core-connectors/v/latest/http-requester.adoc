= HTTP Requester

Use cases for the HTTP Requester

=== Send Authenticated Requests

link:/mule-user-guide/v/latest/authentication-in-http-requests[Authenticated Requests], via *Basic Authentication, Digest and OAuth*

=== Send Multipart HTTP Requests

Use an Attachment component from the palette to upload the file in a POST request with `ContentType: multipart/form-data`. Each attachment is sent in parts.

=== Adding Custom Parameters

The HTTP requester allows you to include maps or singles of the following parameter types:

* query params
* URI params
* headers

=== Changing Default Behavior for Sending Request Body


The message *payload* is the body of the request, except for with methods `GET`, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS`, which mean sending HTTP requests with an empty body (the payload of the Mule message wonâ€™t be used at all). If you need to change this default behavior, you can specify in the *Request Builder*.
//TODO: confirm

Customize the body of the request using the `source` and `target` attributes.

==== Additional Custom Parameters

* Send form parameters with your request, included in the Mule message payload
* Include attachments in your request by adding an Attachment building block to your flow.
//TODO how else to send attachments?
* Set headers, URI parameters explicitly or dynamically, using DataWeave language.
* Send form parameters in `POST` request

=== Streaming through the HTTP Requester

To do so, set the attribute *Request streaming mode*. When streaming, request contains `Transfer-Encoding` header and sends body in chunks until stream consumed; it does not contain the `Content-Length` header.

=== Parsing HTTP Response Body

As with the listener, when HTTP responses have a content type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`, the HTTP Requester automatically parses the message. You can disable this parsing functionality.

=== Validating HTTP Responses

You can set an expression to do this from *Response Settings*.
//TODO how to do this now. Before was done from Success Status Code Validator?
