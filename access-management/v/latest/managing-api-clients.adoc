= Managing API Clients

Client Management allows any client connecting to your application to identify itself using OAuth 2.0.

[NOTE]

External IdP integration for Client management is only available to our Platinum subscription users only.

[CAUTION]
Having a single audience (an Anypoint Platform organization) served by multiple issuers (multiple SAML provider instances) is currently not supported.

[TIP]
Anypoint Platform currently supports Open AM versions 11 and 12

If you want to use openAM for client management and if you're *not using* Anypoint Platform on premises, you need to request that your account be configured in that way, as you can't set this up manually. +
Work with your MuleSoft account representative to ensure that we are aware of your needs for configuring your organization with openAM.
