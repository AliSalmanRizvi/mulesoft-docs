= About Client Authentication with External Identity

As an API owner, you can apply the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy to an API to authenticate client applications that try to access your API. In conjunction with the policy, you need to have a OAuth provider in place. One of the following OAuth providers is recommended:

* OpenAM
* PingFederate

// * OpenID Connect (add after May 6, khahn 4.14.2017)

=== Using Authorization and Authentication

To protect a non-trivial resource, two layers, authorization and authentication, are typically used. The client application receives a client ID and the client secret from the API portal of the Anypoint Platform API. These credentials are provided in tandem with the end-user's credentials when creating an access token. Later, using the token introspection endpoint, the OAuth provider both verifies the validity of the access token and the identity of the client that originally created it.
