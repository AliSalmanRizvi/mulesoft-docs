== Version 3.9.0 - June 21, 2016

Anypoint Connector DevKit 3.9.0 supports two new features for DevKit-built connectors, as well as several fixes for earlier versions.

=== Version 3.9.0 Features

Building a connector using DevKit 3.9.0 (i.e. specifying this version number in the connector project's `pom.xml`) allows the connector end user to retrieve information about the connector's `@Processor`(s) in the Mule Debugger in Anypoint Studio.

For Studio 6.0.2 and later, this version allows the developer to package multiple sets of connector icons to be presented in the Studio Visual Editor depending on the connector end user's preference of Studio UI.

With 3.9.0 you can support two sets of icons for each Studio UI look by first creating two different folders in your connector:

* ​*`theme.light`*​ _(new look)_
* ​*`theme.classic`* _(old look)_

=== Version 3.9.0 Compatibility
